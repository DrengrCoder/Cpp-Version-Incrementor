## Description

A project that builds a binary for the automated version incrementor program.

## Versioning System

This Version Incrementor operates based on the [Semantic Versioning](https://github.com/semver/semver/blob/master/semver.md) standard. A MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.BUILD version numbering system has been adopted, where the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH number is based on the Semantic Versioning documentation standard, and the **Build** number is incremented every time the _build_ command is used. The **Build** can be incremented in one of the following ways, but is not limited to: A Pre-build step in a comprehensive IDE, or a prerequisite step in a Make or CMake based project.
